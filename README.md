Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data
========================

This is course project from Coursera's course "Getting and Cleaning Data"
https://class.coursera.org/getdata-006/human_grading/view/courses/972584/assessments/3/submissions

I clean a data set from wearable computing experiments by www.smartlab.ws 

I get data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip 

run_analysis.R script does the following:
 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
 5. Creates a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
