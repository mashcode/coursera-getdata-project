========================

This is course project from Coursera's course "Getting and Cleaning Data"
https://class.coursera.org/getdata-006/human_grading/view/courses/972584/assessments/3/submissions

I clean a data set from wearable computing experiments by www.smartlab.ws. See details and original code book at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

I get data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and unzip it

R script "run_analysis.R" combine, prepare and aggregate original data.

You can see descriptions of variables and transformations in CodeBook.md
